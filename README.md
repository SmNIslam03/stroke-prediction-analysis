# stroke-prediction-analysis
The aim of this project is to predict the probability of having a stroke using a dataset from Kaggle. The model here will help uncover patterns that are to increase risks of strokes informing people of certain conditions and aspects of their lives that can have a sizeable impact on their health. This will help them make appropriate decisions regarding their health to avoid increasing the risk of developing a stroke.

# Dataset
The dataset utilized can be found at Kaggle: [Stroke Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset/data)

# Setup Instructions
