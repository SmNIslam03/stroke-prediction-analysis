# stroke-prediction-analysis
The aim of this project is to predict the probability of having a stroke using a dataset from Kaggle. The model here will help uncover patterns that are to increase risks of strokes informing people of certain conditions and aspects of their lives that can have a sizeable impact on their health. This will help them make appropriate decisions regarding their health to avoid increasing the risk of developing a stroke.

# Dataset
The dataset utilized can be found at Kaggle: [Stroke Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset/data)

# Setup Instructions

1. **Creating the Virtual Environment**  

To isolate project dependencies, create a virtual environment:  
```bash
python -m venv venv
```

2. **Activating the Virtual Environment**

Activate the virtual environment with the following command:
```bash
source ./venv/bin/activate
```

3. **Installing Required Libraries**

Install all necessary libraries by running:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. **Running the Prediction Notebook**

Open and execute the `stroke_prediction.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook cell by cell to train and evaluate the model.

Note: Make sure you have downloaded the dataset from kaggle and have the `.csv` file in the same folder as the `.ipynb` file
